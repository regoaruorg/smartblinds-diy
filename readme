# smart shades control

1) prerequisites
	1 - a raspberry pi (or a compatible device)
	2 - a bluetooth 4.0+ adapter with bluetooth low energy support (raspberry pi 3 has blue built in)
	3 - a sd card with at least 2 GiB of space and a sd card reader/writer
	4 - a smart shades peripheral that has been previously configured with the app

2) setting up the raspberry pi
	1 - download the lite version of the raspian linux distribution 
			https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	2 - format the sd card (quick format is sufficient)
	3 - open the archive and write the raspian image file to the sd card 
			windows:	http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Flashing_the_SD_Card_using_Windows
			mac osx:	http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Flashing_the_SD_card_using_Mac_OS_X
			linux:		http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Flashing_the_SD_Card_using_Linux_.28including_on_a_Raspberry_Pi.21.29
	4 - insert the sd card to the raspberry pi and power the device
	5 - wait for the operating system to load
	6 - attach a keyboard and a screen or ssh to the raspberry pi
		the default login credentials are 
			username: pi
			password: raspberry
	7 - sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get upgrade
		sudo apt-get install bluez 
		(	if bluez is not available in the package repository or does not contain all required tools {hcitool, gatttool}, 
			instructions on how to install it can be found at: http://www.elinux.org/RPi_Bluetooth_LE#BlueZ_installation    )
	8 - enable the bluetooth adapter:	sudo hciconfig hci0 up
	9 - scan for ble devices (smart shades devices are named RISExxx):		sudo hcitool lescan
	10-	use the provided script to execute commands on the peripheral (sudo is required, launch the python script with the --help option to receive usage instructions)
